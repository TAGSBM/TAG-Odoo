[ DESCRIPTION ]

This will let you remove the page-like look of any form and thus use the whole width of the screen.
Go to the view administration, choose the one you want to change and press the 'Use full width of the screen?' checkbox. Then, save the record.



WARNING:

- You should always check in the 'Inherited Views' tab for the existence of a view of the '_enlarge_form' type.

If it is not there, repeat the operation.
